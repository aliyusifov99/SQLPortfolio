## Description
üîç This project involves a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on aspects such as death rates and vaccination progress across various countries. The aim is to uncover insights and patterns using SQL queries and data analysis techniques.

## Data Source
üìà The analysis utilizes two primary data sources:
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`: Contains detailed data on COVID-19 related deaths globally.
- `CovidVaccination.xlsx`: Provides information on the global COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

## Technologies Used
üíªüîß
- SQL: For querying and manipulating the datasets.
- Excel: For data storage and preliminary data processing.

## Installation and Usage
üõ†Ô∏è To run the SQL queries and view the datasets, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have a SQL server and an Excel viewer installed.
2. Download the data files `CovidDeaths.xlsx` and `CovidVaccination.xlsx`.
3. Import the data into your SQL platform.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the `COVID19 Analysis Portfolio Project.sql` file.

## Project Structure
üìÅ
- `COVID19 Analysis Portfolio Project.sql`: Contains all the SQL queries used for the analysis.
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`: Excel file with COVID-19 death data.
- `CovidVaccination.xlsx`: Excel file with COVID-19 vaccination data.
